<h2 class="section-heading">Disclaimer</h2>

<p>I'm not a medical professional. I am merely summarizing my experimentation and the existing scientific research.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The (Quick) Story</h2>

<p>I recently had a rather miserable cold, and rather than lay down and accept my fate as a groggy, sneezing zombie with a non-functional nose, I decided to beat this thing as quickly as I could and return to my normal life. Here are my findings on how to beat <b>The Common Cold</b> as quickly as possible.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Worked</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Getting 100% of my daily Vitamin C</b> - This was easily accomplished by drinking OJ </li>
    <li><b>Garlic Extract</b> - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y27JD8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002Y27JD8&linkCode=as2&tag=hanz06-20&linkId=ASJMXF2KSOSY4L7Z">I used these off Amazon: Nature's Bounty Odorless Garlic 1000mg</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hanz06-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002Y27JD8" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. According to <a href="http://examine.com/supplements/Garlic/">Examine.com's research</a>, Garlic reduces the length of the Common Cold, and lessens the symptoms. It also has a STRONG effect on preventing future colds if you continue to supplement it.
    </li>
    <li><b>Zinc Lozenges</b> - According to <a href="http://examine.com/supplements/Zinc/">Examine.com's research</a>, Zinc is effective at reducing the length and severity of a cold. You need to take it every few hours until your symptoms subside. The research that proved zinc was effective used lozenges. Other sources say nasal sprays can negatively affect one's ability to smell and taste, so I avoided those. I used these: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013HV9O0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0013HV9O0&linkCode=as2&tag=hanz06-20&linkId=ZUSJY2FNF2KYLWCJ">Now Foods Zinc Gluconate Tablets</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hanz06-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0013HV9O0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
    </li>
    <li><b>African Geranium, in pill form</b> - Also known as Pelargonium Sidoides, this herb lessens the effects and duration of coughing, congestion, and Bronchial issues. I used this particular one: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00138YEZK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00138YEZK&linkCode=as2&tag=hanz06-20&linkId=3T6HEM3TMNL4ZLGN">Nature's Way Umcka ColdCare Chewable</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hanz06-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00138YEZK" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
    </li>
    <li><b>Sleeping as much as possible</b> - I don't feel the need to follow up with scientific research here</li>
    <li><b>Light Exercise</b> - I was initially wrong here, I thought all exercise was bad when you're sick. Apparently moderate exercise can reduce stress and break up congestion.</li>
    <li><b>Water and Hot Tea</b> - staying hydrated, no surprise here</li>
  </ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">Things I Thought That Worked That Didn't</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Getting more than 100% of my daily Vitamin C</b> sorry Emergen-C</li>
    <li><b>Zinc Nasal Sprays</b> - May actually be harmful</li>
    <li><b>Tylenol</b> - Makes you feel better, but doesn't cure your symptoms</li>
    <li><b>Avoiding Exercise</b> - see above</li>
    <li><b>Soup</b> - Doesn't do much beyond hydration</li>
  </ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I managed to cut down a cold that normally affects for me five to seven days down to around three (thats obviously speculation). One thing I noticed is I felt considerable better throughout the day as I took more and more of these meds/supplements. If you've got anymore ideas on getting over a cold, feel free to comment.</p>
