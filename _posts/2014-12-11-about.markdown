<h2 class="section-heading">Why this blog?</h2>

<p>I've often read other people's blogs and realized how completely worthless most are. The content is not interesting or about some stupid niche. So I'm dedicating this blog to exclusively interesting and unheard tips/tricks to improve your quality of life. They will cover physical and mental health, money, social status, and whatever else tickles my fancy.</p>

<p>It goes as follows: All those interesting lifehacker articles, Tim Ferriss book chapters and blog articles, Mr Money Moustache blog articles, and weird health experiments will be put to the test. I will subject my body and bank accounts in order to find the best bang for your buck, easy health improvements, and general purpose life hacks.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Moving Forward</h2>

<p>This should be a fun ride, providing I don't hurt myself or lose all my money. I'm aiming for roughly 1-2 posts every month. I'll promise to keep them fun and brief.</p>

-Hanz
